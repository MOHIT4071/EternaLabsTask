# Axiom Replica — Next.js (Plain CSS edition)

This repo is a Next.js 14 + TypeScript scaffold implementing the token discovery UI using plain CSS (no Tailwind). It's pinned to known-good package versions to reduce installation issues.

## Quick start (Windows PowerShell)

1. Extract the ZIP and open PowerShell in the folder.
2. Run:

```powershell
npm install --legacy-peer-deps --no-audit --no-fund
npm run dev
```

3. Open http://localhost:3000

If install errors appear, paste the last ~40 lines here and I will patch package versions immediately.
